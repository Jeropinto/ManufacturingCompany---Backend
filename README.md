# ManufacturingCompany---Backend
A manufacturing company operates customized ERP, inventory management, supply chain,
shop floor systems built up over decades. Data is isolated in silos, limiting operational
insights. Introducing new capabilities requires complex system coordination.

The lack of data sharing across manufacturing operations severely restricts end-to-end
optimization and automation. For example, inventory and production planning happens in
isolation, leading to shortages, defects, and downtime. The dependency tangle also creates
overhead that slows innovation. The company needs integrated data across business
capabilities to increase quality, reduce costs and improve customer responsiveness.

The solution would identify microservices aligned to manufacturing capabilities like
production and inventory management. There are some specifications:

▪ Develop microservices for inventory, production, quality management.
▪ Expose relevant operations data via APIs controlled by a gateway.
▪ Stream API data to a cloud analytics platform.
▪ Apply analytics and AI to optimize production and quality.
